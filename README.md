# github-clone

This simple Perl script has its roots in an email from a
[good friend](https://github.com/richardcpeterson):

    Maybe there should be a repo browser like your anime downloader
    script. You would run the script, give it the name of a github
    user, and it would let you pull clone some or all of his repos
    into subdirectories. Then you could also add batch fetches and
    stuff.

Thus `github-clone` was born.

# Requirements

1. Perl 5.10 or Higher
2. `common::sense`
3. `LWP`
4. `JSON`
5. `IO::Prompt`

The program should work on any major operating system. It has been tested
on Ubuntu 11.10 and Microsoft Vista 32-bit.

# Usage

    $ ./github-clone <username>

This will clone all of the userâ€™s repositories into the current
directory, and existing repositories will be updated.  For example:

    $ mkdir dumb-crap-by-ejmr && cd dumb-crap-by-ejmr
    $ ./github-clone ejmr
    Cloning or fetching ejmr's 4 repositories
    Press y or n to clone repositories.  The default choice is n.

# Future Plans

I am open to any ideas people might have that would make this script
more useful.  Please feel free to leave feature requests here, or
